## Git vs. GitHub

Git is a version control where it can track your changes for your code. Version control is a system that helps save projects and log all the changes made therefore the user can go back and check their progress.

Github is designed to host your Git repository. It help you save and share your git projects and can also let you control you code outside yout local computer.
